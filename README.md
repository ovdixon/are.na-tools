Chrome extension (MV3) shows two random Are.na blocks everytime you open a new tab; one of your own blocks, and one from a person/channel you follow. Remake of the original extension by a-p.studio which is no longer supported due to MV3.

Chrome extension (MV3) includes screenshot snipping features. The official Are.na API doesn't support direct image uploads, instead the extension implements a workaround using via Cloudflare Workers and R2 storage. Images uploaded through this process are temporary, thanks to an object lifecycle policy on the R2 bucket that automatically deletes them after a set time.
